# P0ppoff - Jules Hablot

Hi folks ! 

I‚Äôm a web crafter - a web dev that like all ecosystem around the dev itself. 

For example, I have created a [vue cli plugin](https://github.com/P0ppoff/vue-cli-plugin-ci) that 
allow you to start a [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) project with a continuous integration file.

I love create **complete dev environment in Javascript world**, as this README with : 
*  test: [markdown lint](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint)
*  CI: [circle CI](https://circleci.com/) ![<P0ppoff>](https://circleci.com/gh/P0ppoff/P0ppoff.svg?style=svg)
